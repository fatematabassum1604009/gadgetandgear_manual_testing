3.	Test Strategy:
As part of Functional Testing, we will follow the below approach for Testing:

Step #1 – Creation of Test Scenarios and Test Cases for the different features in scope.

Step #2 – Our Testing process, when we get an Application for Testing:
• Firstly, we will perform Smoke Testing to check whether the different and important functionalities of the application are working.
• We reject the build, if the Smoke Testing fails and will wait for the stable build before performing in depth testing of the application functionalities.
• Once we receive a stable build, which passes Smoke Testing, we perform in depth testing using the Test Cases created.
• Multiple Test Resources will be testing the same Application on Multiple Supported Environments simultaneously.
• We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send dev. Management the defect found.
• As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing:
•	Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing
•	Regression Testing and Retesting 
•	Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing 
We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product.

Step #3 – We will follow the below best practices to make our Testing better:
•	End-to-End Testing – We will test the end-to-end scenario which involve multiple functionalities to simulate the end user flows.
